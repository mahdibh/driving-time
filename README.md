driving-time
============

Shell script to determine driving times based on the 511 API. This determines driving times between intersections that are supported by the 511 API. A google maps implementation would have been more flexible, unfortunately, google maps offers real time data only for business API clients.

This requires an API token to be stored in ~/.511-token
